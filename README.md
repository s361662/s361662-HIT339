# 🎓 HIT339 – Semester 2 Work  
**Student:** Gislene (s361662)  
This is my little coding corner for everything HIT339 this semester — assignments, labs, experiments, notes… all of it.

## 📁 What’s here (so far)

| Folder | What it’s for |
|--------|----------------|
| `task1-mvcmovie/` | task 1: Microsoft’s MvcMovie tutorial (the original) + my own scrapbook-style twist 💖 |
| `labs/` | Where I’ll pop in any weekly exercises or class demos |
| `docs/` | Notes, screenshots, flowcharts, or random thoughts that helped me along the way |
| `ass1-*` | Reserved for the next big thing (when it drops!) |

> I’ll keep this list updated as the semester rolls along — one commit at a time.

## ▶️ Running the project (task 1)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/s361662/s361662-HIT339.git
cd s361662-HIT339/ass1-mvcmovie
dotnet restore
dotnet watch run

🧵 About task 1 Week-1
This one’s based on the official Microsoft tutorial:
👉 Get started with ASP.NET Core MVC

What I did:

✅ Followed the full MvcMovie tutorial step-by-step

✨ Added my own flair later by turning it into a Scrapbook Catalogue (because that’s so me!)

🌸 Sprinkled some style and comments throughout the code — both for learning and a little personality

You can find all that inside the ass1-mvcmovie/ folder.

💡 Why this repo?
Well, when I look back later, I’ll see the whole journey — mistakes, wins, and little comments like:
